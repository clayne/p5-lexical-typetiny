=head1 NAME

Lexical::TypeTiny - my Int $n

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Types::Standard qw(Int);
  use Lexical::TypeTiny;
  
  my Int $n = 42;
  $n += 0.5;   # dies, not an Int

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lexical::TypeTiny is similar in spirit to L<Type::Tie>, but:

=over

=item *

It's a lot faster because it uses L<Variable::Magic> instead of C<tie>.

=item *

It's limited to only scalar variables, no arrays or hashes.
(Of course, those scalars may be arrayrefs or hashrefs.)

=item *

Does not (currently) support coercion.

=item *

It's limited to simple type constraints like C<ArrayRef>, and not
parameterized type constraints like C<< ArrayRef[Int] >>. (This is
a limitation of the syntax Perl will parse, not a limitation of the
complexity of type constraints supported. You can define a 
C<ArrayRef_of_Int> type constraint in your own type library, and
it will work.)

=item *

Although an exception is thrown if you try to assign an invalid
value to the variable, the assignment still happens. In the L</SYNOPSIS>,
if you caught the exception and then examined C<< $n >>, it would be
42.5.

(This particular aspect of Lexical::TypeTiny's behaviour is not fixed
in stone and may change in a future version.)

=back

Because of the way Perl parses lexical variable types, if you wish to
declare, say C<< my Int $x >>, there needs to exist a class called
C<Int>. That class doesn't have to actually I<do> anything; it doesn't
need constructors, methods, etc.

Lexical::TypeTiny will create such classes for you at import time,
however to do so, it needs to know what type constraints you are planning
on using. This means B<< you need to import your type libraries before
importing Lexical::TypeTiny >>.

Good:

  use Types::Standard qw(Int);
  use Lexical::TypeTiny;

Bad:

  use Lexical::TypeTiny;
  use Types::Standard qw(Int);

=head2 Disabling Type Checks

  use Lexical::TypeTiny -nocheck;

=head1 BUGS

There currently seem to be issues with threaded Perls. Hopefully these can
be solved pretty soon.
